**Android**: A Linux-based operating system using Google's Bionic libc instead of glibc and many interfaces not found on desktop Linux-based operating systems. Many standard Linux concepts are restricted and abstracted away from applications, though many are still accessible (but unsupported).

**Bash**: The most popular shell, preinstalled on many distributions.

**Distribution**: A typically free software, glibc-based Linux-based operating system.

**Linux**: Technically only the name of the kernel for Linux-based operating systems, but is also used for these operating systems by most people.

**Package Manager**: A program to manage your other installed programs and update them. Typically a distribution has one package manager it uses.

**Shell**: A program running in a terminal that accepts commands from the user and executes them.

**System Call**: Programs can use functions from the operating system only in an interface the operating system exposes to them. This interface is the mechanism of system calls. Things like reading, writing, creating and deleting files, connecting to the internet and communicating with other programs is all realized with system calls under the hood.

**Terminal**: A device with a text display and a keyboard. Also used for terminal emulators.

**Terminal Emulator**: A program that accepts commands and text like a hardware terminal, but outputs them on a window on a pixel-based display.
